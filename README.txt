6- Additional description for the task:
	I usually use Redis for Backend of RabbitMQ, but sadly I did not have it on my laptop
      	      and when I wanted to install Redis on it unfortunately, due to the VPN not being
      	      connected and the net speed being very low on Thursdays and Friday. because of it,
      	      I couldn't download redis image and install it and I had to use the "cache+memory".
